# Purpose 
From the #ArtProject community, this is a piece for the Doge-Ethereum Bridge art installation that is connected to the Blockchain. The installation, designed by Jessica Angel and Sponsored by TrueBit, will be a Klein Bottle structure that will fit around 40 people and be on display for about one year. The considered location for the bridge is the Hinge Park (Olimpic Village) as part of the Vancouver Bienale 2018. This repo is meant to be a place where we share everything we have done to build this piece of the installation, sponsored by Status, so that it may be replicated by you, the reader. Here are some preview pictures of what the overall structure will look like; to be clear, the Whisper Mailbox will be a key interactive piece inside of this structure. 


# Interaction and result
There will be two mining blocks made of of illuminated plastic. Each will represent mining on the ethereum blockchain. The viewer uses a pick axe to "mine" each block. As they do so, the lights change color to indicate their progression. Once a block has been mined, the user can scan a QR code and obtain a token.
